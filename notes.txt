3. render books with following info (title, authors,  descriptions, image thubmnail, link to more info )

4. a save  button  on the book card 

5. when save button clicked, create a  new  book document in db  

6. render all saved books as well with a 'view button' and a 'delete button'/ 'view-button' will get to google book info link. 'delete button' will remove the book from db. 

7. create a mongoose Book schema.

8.  Add the following Express routes for your app:

* `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

* `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

* `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

* `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`. Make sure you have this _after_ all other routes are defined.

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."
